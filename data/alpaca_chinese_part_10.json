All animals are sentient creatures, capable of feeling pain and emotions, and should be treated as such.

Animals should only be used in research if they have been humanely treated and their wellbeing has been taken into consideration. \n\nWe must remember that animals are fellow creatures of this world, and we should treat them with the same compassion and respect that we would treat any living being.

        "en_output": "A ReLU activation function (Rectified Linear Unit) is a type of mathematical decision-making unit used in Artificial Neural Networks. It is a piecewise linear function that calculates the output of a given input node by mapping it to 0 if it is less than 0 or to a positive value otherwise. The ReLU activation function is one of the most commonly used activation functions for deep learning applications due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. Its main feature is to introduce non-linearity into the network, allowing for more intricate patterns to be detected.  It is also easy to compute and even easier to implement with software or hardware.  It's most notable applications are in the field of image-recognition and audio-processing.  ReLU enables the network to learn its own features, allowing for better predictions and increases in accuracy.  It speeds up training by reducing the vanishing gradient problem and improving generalization accuracy.  Overall, ReLU shows very good performance in practice and its simplicity makes it a popular choice.",

        "en_output": "Abstract art is a form of non-representational art that is heavily influenced by the idea of personal expression and subjectivity. It is characterized by its use of unconventional techniques, such as distorted shapes and color blocking, to evoke feelings and communicate ideas without relying on traditional images or forms. \n\nAn abstract painting will often contain elements of both representational and abstract art; however, it does not feature recognizable images or figures. Instead, abstract works make use of shapes, colors, and brushstrokes to create an emotional response. The purpose of abstract art is to use vibrant colors and shapes to convey an idea or emotion without relying on the depiction of a realistic scene or object. \n\nAbstract art has been around since the 19th century, when artists began pushing the boundaries of art beyond the traditional forms that existed in previous eras. The advent of abstract art is credited to Wassily Kandinsky, a Russian painter and art theorist who is widely considered to be the father of abstract art. \n\nAbstract art is often associated with the likes of Picasso, Kandinsky, and Matisse, but this style of art can be extremely varied and personal. Many modern artists have incorporated elements of abstract art into their works, creating vivid and dynamic paintings that emphasize individual expression. \n\nAbstract art is a great way to express emotion and feelings without the use of traditional images. It encourages us to think about how we see the world and how we can convey ideas, thoughts, and feelings using unconventional shapes and colors. Abstract art has allowed artists to explore new depths of emotion and share their visions with their audience.",
        "output": "抽象艺术是一种非代表性艺术形式，深受个人表达和主观性观念的影响。它的特点是使用非常规技术，例如扭曲的形状和色块，在不依赖传统图像或形式的情况下唤起感情和交流思想。\n\n抽象绘画通常包含代表性和抽象艺术的元素;但是，它没有可识别的图像或图形。相反，抽象作品利用形状、颜色和笔触来创造情感反应。抽象艺术的目的是使用鲜艳的色彩和形状来传达想法或情感，而不依赖于对现实场景或物体的描绘。\n\n抽象艺术自19世纪以来一直存在，当时艺术家开始将艺术的界限推向超越以前时代存在的传统形式。抽象艺术的出现归功于俄罗斯画家和艺术理论家瓦西里·康定斯基，他被广泛认为是抽象艺术之父。\n\n抽象艺术通常与毕加索、康定斯基和马蒂斯等人联系在一起，但这种艺术风格可以非常多样化和个性化。许多现代艺术家将抽象艺术的元素融入他们的作品中，创造出生动而充满活力的绘画，强调个人表达。\n\n抽象艺术是在不使用传统图像的情况下表达情感和感受的好方法。它鼓励我们思考我们如何看待世界，以及如何使用非常规的形状和颜色传达想法、思想和感受。抽象艺术使艺术家能够探索新的情感深度，并与观众分享他们的愿景。"

Feature engineering is the process of transforming existing features to create new features that better capture the information contained in the raw data. Data normalization is used to rescale the values of certain features to a standard range which allows for more meaningful comparisons between features. In feature selection, irrelevant and redundant features are removed to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its accuracy.",

Sea levels dropped, the effects of climate change were reversed, and governments were quickly forced to abandon their old systems and come together to form a more unified, harmonious world.\n\nBut even as the people of the planet rejoiced, a dark undercurrent lurked beneath the surface.  Those same scientists had manipulated the ice to open up portals – to impossible, alternate dimensions – pulling alien life forms and powerful new technologies into our own. \n\nThe world would never be the same, and the story of the man who had the courage to accept this new reality and fight for a future he believed in had only just begun.",

Max walked for what felt like hours, and soon became lost in the winding city streets. Despite being in an unfamiliar area, the small yellow glow kept drawing him in. \n\nEventually, Max found himself in a sleepy neighborhood, almost eerie in its quietness. He approached a nearby building, and as soon as he reached it, the yellow glow vanished. With a curious mind and a hint of suspicion, he opened the creaky door and stepped inside. \n\nMax found himself in a round room. There was nothing else in the whole building, but at the center of the room was a small pedestal, illuminated by a bright yellow light. He cautiously looked at the pedestal, and upon closer inspection saw a beautiful, golden locket hung on a thin chain. \n\nMax had found a forgotten treasure. In all his years of walking, he couldn't help but wonder why this locket was here, and what secrets it might hide. He slowly took it into his hands, marveling at its weight and the intricate detail of its intricate design. He slowly opened it, and inside there was a small, neatly written note:\n\n\"Max, sometimes you find the most special memories in the least expected places. Wear this, and remember to always believe in yourself.\" \n\nMax was absolutely delighted as he examined his newfound treasure—a precious reminder of the wonders that life can bring. He put the locket around his neck and continued on his adventure. \n\nThe next day, Max returned to the little building, only to find it had vanished. The mysterious yellow glow, the locket, and the note—they had all disappeared. Through the night, Max realized the magical feeling he had felt the day before had been real—he laughed and smiled as he thought of the wonderful memory of his little adventure. \n\nMax still wears the locket wherever he goes, grateful for the beautiful reminder of life's mysteries. He cherishes it, forever grateful for the wonderful memory.",

It can also create an inefficient allocation of resources, as the protection of particular industries can be used to prop up inefficient businesses that would otherwise fail. Moreover, protectionist policies can lead to retaliatory tariffs and protectionist cycles that can do more harm than good to a country's economy.",
