        "en_output": "Natural language processing (NLP) is the process of using machine learning algorithms to extract and analyze the meaning of human language. For text classification, the process involves first preprocessing the text by tokenizing it and removing irrelevant data, such as stop words. Next, features such as n-grams and part-of-speech tags can be extracted from the text. Finally, the features can be used to train a classification model, such as a support vector machine or logistic regression, which can be used to classify the text into a pre-defined set of categories. The process can be automated and is highly scalable, making it an excellent tool for text classification.",

        "en_output": "The three major sociological theories are structural functionalism, symbolic interactionism and conflict theory. Structural functionalism is a sociological theory that explains how social structures and social functions are bound together. Its premise is that society is composed of systems that interact to maintain stability. Symbolic interactionism is a theory that focuses on understanding how individuals interact and how meaning is created in interactions. It states that language and symbols are used to define reality, and that when people interact, they interpret these symbols to reach shared meanings. Conflict theory is a theory that views society as divided into different groups, which are in conflict with each other to gain resources, power, and status. It explains that the power and resources in society are unevenly distributed leading to an unequal balance of power among groups. Social change is propelled when groups with unequal power engage in conflict and strive for an equilibrium of power. \n\nThese three theories provide a foundation for understanding human behavior in a social context. Structural functionalism explains the interaction between individuals and their roles in a larger institution, symbolic interactionism focuses on understanding the meanings created in social interaction, and conflict theory views society as polarized with power struggles. By understanding these theories, we can further understand the complex dynamics of our social world.",
        "output": "三大社会学理论是结构功能主义、符号互动主义和冲突理论。结构功能主义是一种社会学理论，它解释了社会结构和社会功能是如何联系在一起的。它的前提是社会是由相互作用以维持稳定的系统组成的。符号互动主义是一种理论，侧重于理解个人如何互动以及如何在互动中创造意义。它指出，语言和符号用于定义现实，当人们互动时，他们会解释这些符号以达到共同的含义。冲突理论是一种将社会划分为不同群体的理论，这些群体相互冲突以获得资源、权力和地位。它解释说，社会中的权力和资源分配不均，导致群体之间权力的不平等平衡。当权力不平等的群体参与冲突并争取权力平衡时，社会变革就会被推动。\n\n这三种理论为理解社会背景下的人类行为提供了基础。结构功能主义解释了个人之间的相互作用及其在更大机构中的角色，符号互动主义侧重于理解社会互动中创造的意义，冲突理论认为社会因权力斗争而两极分化。通过理解这些理论，我们可以进一步了解我们社会世界的复杂动态。"

After mustering up all of her courage, she opened the door and peered inside. What she found was astonishing- a room filled with trinkets, books, and artifacts that nearly took her breath away. Sitting atop of a shelf was an old, dusty book adorned with mysterious symbols. When Eliza opened the book, she was astonished to discover that it was full of ancient spells and charms.\n\nUtterly mesmerized, Eliza was determined to learn the secrets of magic and attempted to red the book. To her amazement, Eliza found she could understand the book's instructions and began practicing the spells and charms it contained. Soon, Eliza's room was filled with the smell of burning herbs and strange magical artifacts that seemed to whisper secrets to her.\n\nAs Eliza became more confident in her magic, she used it to help others in her village. In time, her magic was so powerful that it seemed as if miracles would happen whenever Eliza spoke a spell. Despite her newfound power, Eliza never used her gifts for evil or selfish purposes and her heart was always filled with love and compassion. \n\nThough she faced her fair share of danger and adventure, Eliza always managed to make it through thanks to the strength of her magic. Eliza's tale is a reminder to us all that true power comes not from magic, but from the heart.",

Another concern is the potential threat of technology replacing or displacing jobs.

Cyclones are intense low-pressure cyclonic storms that cause heavy rains and strong wind gusts, often leading to flooding and death. Droughts are periods of unusually low precipitation that can lead to water shortages, crop failure, and famine. Landslides occur when high levels of precipitation cause the soil and rocks to become unstable and slide downhill, resulting in property damage. Avalanches occur when a large mass of snow is destabilized and slides down a mountain. Extreme temperatures can be experienced in the summers due to heat waves and in the winters due to cold waves, causing deadly heat- and cold- related illnesses. Earthquakes can occur due to tectonic plate shifts, resulting in injures and deaths as well as destruction of property and infrastructure. Finally, air pollution caused by factors such as burning of fossil fuels, automobiles, and industrial plants can lead to respiratory diseases and poor public health.",

Hydraulic brakes use hydraulic pressure to stop the vehicle, with pressure being generated when the driver presses the brakes on the pedal. Electrical brakes, on the other hand, use an electric motor to stop a vehicle. They are typically found in electric vehicles, where the motor is used to slow or stop the car, as opposed to the internal combustion engine of a normal vehicle. Hydraulic brakes are more efficient and require less maintenance, while electrical brakes are quieter and require less force from the driver to activate.",

But one day, things changed drastically. \n\nCaleb was walking in the gardens near his castle when he suddenly became dizzy and fell into a deep sleep. No one knew what had happened. None of the doctors in the kingdom had any answer, and every attempt at waking him up failed. A dark spell had been cast on him, and no one could break it. \n\nDesperate, the king called together all the magical and wise creatures in the land. He asked what could be done to free his son from this cruel fate, but all efforts failed. \n\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. The kingdom mourned the fact that their beloved prince seemed to be gone forever; they knew they should move on but it was still too painful to accept. \n\nThen, one day, an unlikely hero appeared in the kingdom. She was an old witch by the name of Cinne, who had been living in the nearby woods. She said she could break the spell on Caleb, but in order to do so, someone must take Caleb on a journey of exploration and discovery. With no other choice, the king agreed and tasked his bravest warrior, Sir William, with this mission.\n\nSo, with the witch's guidance, Sir William set off with the sleeping prince in tow to find the things that would break the spell. He encountered dragons, fairies, and magical creatures during his perilous journey, all to wake the Prince from his long sleep.\n\nOnly time will tell if they will fulfill their quest and if the prince will be able to wake from his slumber. Will they be able to break the spell, or will they be forever lost?",
